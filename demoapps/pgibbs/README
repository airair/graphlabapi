The pgibbs folder contains the implementations of the parallel Gibbs
samplers described in:

  Parallel Gibbs Sampling: From Colored Fields to Think Junction Trees
   by Joseph Gonzalez, Yucheng Low, Arthur Gretton, and Carlos Guestrin

Because the sampler.cpp is currently taylored to the Alchemy
intermediate factor format we recommend using the precompiled matlab
binaries in the matlab folder.  The matlab interface uses a very
simple discrete factorized model representation.

However for those interested in understanding the code better here is
a brief synopsis of the files:

  sampler.cpp:
