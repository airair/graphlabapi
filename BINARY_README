============
Introduction
============

GraphLab is a graph-based, high performance, distributed computation framework
written in C++.  

GraphLab Features:

Unified multicore/
distributed API:       write once run anywhere 

Tuned for performance: optimized C++ execution engine leverages extensive 
                       multi-threading and asynchronous IO 

Scalable:              Run on large cluster deployments by
                       intelligently placing data and computation 

HDFS Integration:      Access your data directly from HDFS 

Powerful Machine 
Learning Toolkits:     Tackle challenging machine 
                       learning problems with ease


For more details on the GraphLab see http://graphlab.org, including
documentation, tutorial, etc.

The source code and documentation for all applications can be found at 
http://docs.graphlab.org/toolkits.html


========
Mac OS X
========
The Mac OS X build is restricted and is compiled without HDFS support, nor
distributed capabilities. All toolkits therefore run entirely on one machine
in shared memory.

These binaries have been tested to run on OS X 10.6 or greater. Though they
may work on 10.5 as well. Please let us know if you encounter any issues.

=====
Linux
=====
The Linux builds are more complex due to varying glibc versions as well as the
need to support both OpenMPI and MPICH2. Two binary releases are provided, one
for OpenMPI and one for MPICH2. Please obtain the package matching the MPI 
library you have on your cluster: they are not compatible.

Each binary is paired with a matching shell script which sets up the
execution environment (by forcing the load of provided versions of system
binaries). Several environment variables are used to control the process. 

  JAVA_HOME
     Either JAVA_HOME or JVM_SO_PATH must be set. 
     This must point to the Java home directory.
     For instance: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk
     This was tested with Oracle's implementation of Java (sun-jdk or open-jdk).

  JVM_SO_PATH
     Either JAVA_HOME or JVM_SO_PATH must be set. 
     Optional. The script will expect to find libjvm.so in 
     $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/client/libjvm.so or
     $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so
     If libjvm.so is not in either locations, the script will fail. In which 
     case, you should set this variable to the directory containing libjvm.so.

  USE_SYSTEM_LIBS
     Optional. If set, the system's glibc (and other system dependencies) 
     will be used instead of the provided versions. 


HDFS Capability is compiled in. If HDFS is to be used, the 
"hadoop" command must be available.


Additional Notes for OpenMPI
----------------------------
Unlike the MPICH2 build, the OpenMPI build is unable to static link
everything. Furthermore, OpenMPI v1.5 and v1.6 has compatibility issues
with the GraphLab build. GraphLab relies on libevent for communication
and OpenMPI v1.5 as well as OpenMPI v1.6 incorrectly exports the
evutil_* functions resulting in a conflict between GraphLab's libevent
and OpenMPI's libevent. OpenMPI v1.7 seems to fix this problem.

We therefore provide only binary releases built against OpenMPI 1.3.2
which should be binary compatible with 1.4. I can provide builds
against OpenMPI 1.7 is there is demand for it.
