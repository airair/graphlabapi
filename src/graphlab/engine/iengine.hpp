  /**
     \brief The abstract interface of a GraphLab engine.
     The graphlab engine interface describes the core functionality
     provided by all graphlab engines.  The engine is templatized over
     the type of graph.
     
     The GraphLab engines are a core element of the GraphLab
     framework.  The engines are responsible for applying a the update
     tasks and sync operations to a graph and shared data using the
     scheduler to determine the update schedule. This class provides a
     generic interface to interact with engines written to execute on
     different platforms.
     
     While users are free to directly instantiate the engine of their
     choice we highly recommend the use of the \ref core data
     structure to manage the creation of engines. Alternatively, users
     can use the 
     \ref gl_new_engine "graphlab::engine_factory::new_engine"
     static functions to create
     engines directly from configuration strings.

     * invoked on all machines simultaneously.  For example:
     *
     * \code
     * graphlab::synchronous_engine<vprog> engine(dc, graph, opts);
     * engine.signal(0); // signal vertex zero

     * should only be used to schedule a small set of vertices. The
     * preferred method to signal a large set of vertices (e.g., all
     * vertices that are a certain type) is to use either the vertex
     * program init function or the aggregation framework.  For
     * example to signal all vertices that have a particular value one
     * could write:
     *
     * \code
     * struct bipartite_opt : 
     *   public graphlab::ivertex_program<graph_type, gather_type> {
     *   // The user defined init function
     *   void init(icontext_type& context, vertex_type& vertex) {
     *     // Signal myself if I am a certain type
     *     if(vertex.data().on_left) context.signal(vertex);
     *   }
     *   // other vastly more interesting code
     * };
     * \endcode
     *
     * @param [in] vid the vertex id to signal
     * @param [in] message the message to send to that vertex.  The
     * default message is sent if no message is provided.
     */

     * 
     * This function sends the same message to all vertices which will

     * \code
     * graphlab::synchronous_engine<pagerank> engine(dc, graph, opts);
     * engine.signal_all();
     * engine.start();
