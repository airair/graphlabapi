the emxarrays can be serialized and deserialized
However. keep in mind that the deserialization requires that the emxarray be
freeed first as it cannot do it for you. Due to a lack of a constructor for the
emxarray datastructures, it is impossible to tell if the pointers inside the
emxarray are real pointers, or are random garbage.
