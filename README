Graphlab 1.0
==================================================================
Designing and implementing efficient and provably correct parallel 
machine learning (ML) algorithms can be very challenging. Existing 
high-level parallel abstractions like MapReduce are often insufficiently 
expressive while low-level tools like MPI and Pthreads leave ML experts 
repeatedly solving the same design challenges. By targeting common 
patterns in ML, we developed GraphLab, which improves upon abstractions 
like MapReduce by compactly expressing asynchronous iterative algorithms 
with sparse computational dependencies while ensuring data consistency 
and achieving a high degree of parallel performance.

For more details on the GraphLab see: http://graphlab.ml.cmu.edu

Compilation
==================================================================
If you already have CMake and Boost available, you can just run 
1a: ./configure

Otherwise, autodetect, install and build boost and CMake.
1b: ./configure --bootstrap 


The configure script will create three subdirectories
debug/
release/
profile/
With different configuration profiles.

cd into any of the subdirectories and run "make" will compile the entire 
GraphLab library + demoapps + unit tests. "make install" will install the
graphlab library.


Running Unit Tests
==================================================================
# switch into any of the build subdirectories
1:  cd debug/ or cd release/ or cd profile/

# cd into the tests directory
2:  cd tests/

# run the test script 
3:  ./runtest.sh
